# Keep-Away-Chess-Game
Some homework project I am working on
When it is completed, the game should work like this:
Begins by asking the first player which peice they want, Bishop or Rook, 
then gives the second player the peice player one does not use.
Then asks player one for coordinates, first row, then column 0-7, should 
not allow a number beyond 7 or letter in, passes an exception.

Then they can begin playing the game, the Rooks cover area in horizontal and vertical directions
Bishops cover Diagonal area, whoever places their peice in a spot that can be taken by an enemy peice
loses. Then asks if they want to play again.
